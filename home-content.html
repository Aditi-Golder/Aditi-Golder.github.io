		<h2>Biography</h2>
		<p>I was born in Gopalganj, Dhaka, Bangladesh. I am currently a graduate student in the Department of Computer Science at Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC, where I was awarded a full-ride scholarship through a Graduate Teaching Assistantship. In addition, I work as a Graduate Research Assistant in the Intelligent Remote Sensing in Conservation & Discovery Group (IRSC Lab) at Wake Forest University under the supervision of <a href="https://paucavp.sites.wfu.edu/" target="_blank" class="prof-link">Dr. Paul Pauca</a>.</p>
		<p>Prior to joining Wake Forest University, I earned my Master’s degree in Information Technology from Jahangirnagar University, Savar, Bangladesh, under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://juniv.edu/teachers/akkas" target="_blank" class="prof-link">K M Akkas Ali</a>. During this period, I collaborated remotely with <a href="https://www.ku.ac.ae/college-people/zeyar-aung" target="_blank" class="prof-link">Dr. U Zeyar Aung</a> from Khalifa University, UAE, and <a href="https://about.uq.edu.au/experts/32270" target="_blank" class="prof-link">Dr. Mohammad Ali Moni</a> from The University of Queensland, Australia. I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering at Daffodil International University, Dhaka, Bangladesh, under the supervision of <a href="https://faculty.daffodilvarsity.edu.bd/profile/itm/nusrat-jahan.html" target="_blank" class="prof-link">Dr. Nusrat Jahan</a>.</p>
		<p>Beyond academics, I believe nature has a powerful healing influence. I enjoy traveling and spending my free time in natural settings. I also like reading books, listening to music, and experimenting with new cuisines.</p>

		<h2>Research Interests</h2>
		<p>My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision, machine learning, and remote sensing. I focus on developing automated, efficient, and interpretable machine learning systems, with particular emphasis on:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Graph theory and representation learning</li>
			<li>Generative AI for data-efficient training</li>
			<li>Model robustness, transparency, and trustworthy ML</li>
			<li>Applications in remote sensing and visual understanding</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Ultimately, I strive to make machine learning models more resource-efficient, transparent, and trustworthy, while solving real-world problems responsibly.</p>
